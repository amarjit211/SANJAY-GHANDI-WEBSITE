<p>
    Butterflies are day-flying insects and considered to be the agents of pollination of some plants.They are cold-blooded and cannot
     fly if their body temperature is less than 30 degree centigrade. A butterfly has compound eyes with each eye made up of about 6000 tiny parts called lenses; 
     it is fascinating to know that a butterfly can see in all directions except directly underneath its body. Butterflies feed chiefly
      on nectar from flowers. There are over 20,000 species of butterflies worldwide. At Sanjay Gandhi National Park we have a whopping 170 Species of butterflies,
     out of around 1500 species found in India.
